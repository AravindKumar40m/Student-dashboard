# Student Dashboard

The Student Dashboard is a web application designed to visualize student data, including login statistics, academic performance, and attendance. It provides comprehensive insights into individual student progress, comparative analysis with peers, and detailed breakdowns of grades and credits.

## Features

- _Login Student Details_: Display detailed information about the logged-in student upon accessing the dashboard.
- _Overall CGPA Calculation_: Calculate the overall Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) for the logged-in student and visualize it using a progress chart.
- _Semester-wise GPA Analysis_: Calculate the Grade Point Average (GPA) for each semester and display it in a table. Visualize the GPA trend over semesters using a line chart.
- _Class Rank Comparison_: Compare the CGPA of the logged-in student with other students to determine their class rank.
- _Subject Grades Distribution_: Generate a pie chart illustrating the distribution of grades for each subject taken by the logged-in student. Also, provide a comparison with the overall grades distribution for all students.
- _Overall Student Credit Analysis_: Calculate the overall credits earned by the student and represent them in a polar chart. Additionally, display the total credits earned by the logged-in student.
- _Comparative Analysis with Peers_: Allow users to select another student by their roll number and compare the CGPA of the logged-in student with the selected student.
- _Semester-wise GPA Comparison_: Visualize the comparison of each semester's GPA with the class average using a line chart.
- _Attendance Analysis_: Display attendance statistics of the logged-in student using a bar chart.
